üî•**Welcome to My Page!**üî•

Hello, I am Chenghao Lin. I studied mechanical design, manufacturing and automation at [Beijing University of Chemical Technology](https://english.buct.edu.cn/main.htm) for the first three years. In the fourth year, I came to the [University of Detroit Mercy](https://www.udmercy.edu/) to study robotics. My interests are robots, navigation, path planning and control.

# üî• News

- *2023.09*: &nbsp;üè´üè´ Come to the University of Detroit to learn more about robotics!
